This project "Command line for the win" help me to use SFTP 
to move files from my local machine to sanboxes server:
This is the steps I followed to use the SFTP command-line tool:
1- I take all require sreenshots for tasks with appropriate names
2- i run my sandbox in webterm and clone the repo, then i create the required folder
3- I run command prompt in my local machine
4- i connected to the sandbox with the command line: sftp username@hostname
5- Then i copy and past the password
6- I navigete into the folder /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
   with the command cd
7- i verify that with pwd
8- Then i navigate in the folder that contained my screenshots in my local machine with 
   the command lcd
9- i verify that by typing 'lls' to display all files and folder in working directory
10- Then i use put to upload my file into my remote server
11- After i check again by typing ls
12 - And then i exit connection in my local machine; come back to sand box and push my work
   on GitHub

Thanks :)
